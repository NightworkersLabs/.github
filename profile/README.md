## Overview

We have 2 projects ongoing right now:

- 1 active (https://github.com/Nightworkers-P2E/cross-casino) > An EVM Multi-chain provably-fair Casino, with off-chain backend, partners tracking and stats
- 1 dormant (https://github.com/Nightworkers-P2E/resort) > A single chain gaming environment, with Hooker / Pimp NFT Mint, P2E, on-chain casino and Vault

They both depends on their own fork of:

- https://github.com/Nightworkers-P2E/smartend for the smart contracts (deployment, source code, tests)
- https://github.com/Nightworkers-P2E/offchain-service (backend services)
